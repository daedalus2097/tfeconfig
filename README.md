# TFEConfig
Control map file editor for Amiga port of [The Force Engine (TFE)](https://github.com/BSzili/TheForceEngine). TFE uses a binary file (tfe_input_remapping.bin) to store all its input mappings; TFEConfig provides a GUI editor for this file. The current executable archive can be found in the [Releases](https://github.com/daedalus2097/tfeconfig/releases/latest) area.

Written in AmiBlitz3 - this will not compile in Blitz Basic 2 without modifications.

See TFEConfig.readme for full details
